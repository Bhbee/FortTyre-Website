# üìú Basic Overview

This part of the project is the API for an E-comerce website `A restful API`


# üõ† Tech Details

This project was built primarily with `Nodejs(Expressjs)`, `Typescript`, `MongoDB` (Database), and `Passport`.

Other tools used for maintaining a standard project workflow and structure include `eslint` for linking and `prettier` for code formatting and `npm` for package management.
Other Third party API include `Cloudinary`, `Paystack` and `Passport` for google Oauth.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up & Running the Project

- After cloning the project, change directory to the folder
- Install all the js dependencies using `$ npm install`. 


```
üí° You will need an .env file. Create one with the following keys. But add your own correct values:
origin = "add your value" //the value shpuld contain the website(frontend url that will be making calls to the api)
baseUrl = "https://forttyreapi.onrender.com"
PORT = 3000
MONGO_URL = "add your value"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN = "add your value"
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN = "add your value"

//create a google APIS acount
googleClientId = "add your value"
googleClientSecret = "add your value"
googleOauthRedirectUrl = "add your value"

cookieSessionKey = "add your value"

//create a nodemailer account 
nodemailerMail = "add your value"
nodemailerPass = "add your value"

 //Create a cloudinary account
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = add your value
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = add your value
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = add your value

//create a paystack dev account
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY = add your value
PAYSTACK_BASE_URL = add your value
PUBLIC_KEY = "add your value"


JWT_SECRET= "add your value"
```
- Now you can run the server`npm start`

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run

#### npm start

To start the server and connect to database

#### npm build

To build the typescript files into javascript files

## üß± Project Structure

### The top level directory structure implementing separation of concerns is as follows:
- [config](src%2F%40config) - Contains configuration settings for the database connection and google Oauth using passport.
- [controllers](src%2Fcontrollers) - Contains files whch acts intermediaries between input received from user and the Models.  
- [middlewares](src%2F%40types) - Contains essential components which acts as a middleman in a request-response cycle.
- [models](src%2Fmodels) - Contains files that represents the application's data, the rules and constraints enforced on those data.
- [routers](src%2Fcontrollers) - Contains files that defines the routes or endpoints of the web application,
- [types](src%2F%40types) - Contains a global type for req.user
- [utilities](src%2Futilities) - Contains utilities [tools, libraries, functions] that provides certain useful functionalities to assist in development

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Walkthrough of the API

- As previously mentioned in the previous sections of this README, I made use of Nodejs(ExpressJS) and Typecript PL.
